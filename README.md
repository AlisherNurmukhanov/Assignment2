## Goal

Goal of the application is to make people around the world have access, also with lyrics, to Qazaq Music easily. Share our culture of music.

## What problems does our app solve?

As I mentioned, in such "big" platforms as Apple Music, Spotify, Yandex Music and e.g. there is no much variety of Qazaq music. Our free app make our music easy to access, also verified, authorized qazaq singers can upload their music there.
